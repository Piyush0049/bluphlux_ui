# Interview Scheduling Application

Hi, I'm Piyush Joshi. This project is an Interview Scheduling application designed to streamline the process of scheduling, managing, and tracking interviews. The app offers a seamless user experience by providing a responsive interface and robust functionalities for scheduling interviews with candidates and interviewers.

## Assignment Overview

This project was developed as part of an assignment with the following requirements:

- **Interview Scheduling**
  - Display a list of available time slots.
  - Allow users to schedule an interview by selecting:
    - Candidate name.
    - Interviewer name.
    - Date and time slot.
    - Interview type (e.g., Technical, HR, Behavioral).
  - Validate for conflicts (e.g., overlapping interviews for the same interviewer or candidate).

- **Interview Dashboard**
  - Display a calendar or timeline view of all scheduled interviews.
  - Enable filtering by date, interviewer, or candidate.

- **Rescheduling/Editing Interviews**
  - Allow updates to an interviewâ€™s details (e.g., time or interviewer).
  - Persist changes seamlessly.

- **Deleting Interviews**
  - Enable deleting scheduled interviews with confirmation.

- **Notifications**
  - Display success or error messages upon scheduling, updating, or deleting interviews.
